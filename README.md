## Overall Findings
1. Age : 30-70 were spending more money, but less likely to accept campaigns. Higher volume here though.
2. Catalog was more likely to accept campaigns, but in person spend more. Recommend a split between all. 40% Catalog, 30% Web and 30% Store
3. Focus on people with less kids
4. Education has no impact - don't target any group
5. Marital Status - doesn't play a big part. Married, Single, Together, spend more money.

## Recommendations

1. Money Making : Middle Aged, People, high earners, with no kids. Target on different platforms with the above split

2. For New Users to Spend Money : Focus on 21-30, 70 and up- who statistically accepted campaigns at a higher rate.

3. Since the age range from 31 to 70 is spending a significant amount of money, the com[any should focus their efforts on this group and tailor their campaigns to encourage even more spending.

4. The age ranges from 23 to 30 years old and 71 to 85 years old may be spending less, but they are more receptive to marketing campaigns. Therefore, the marketing department should target these groups with campaigns designed to increase their spending.

5. In order to increase spending among individuals aged 23 to 30 who accept the campaign, they can adapt and focus the campaign specifically on this age range.

6. The company can enhance their efforts towards customers with higher percentage catalog purchases and then they should prioritize their focus on "In Store/Web" channels as they attract more traffic.

7. Customers who are married, single, or together spend more money compared to widowed and divorced individuals. Given this insight, the company should focus on targeting this segment.
